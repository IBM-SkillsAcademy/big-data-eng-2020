To customize the VM for the Big SQL labs:
 1. Download three scripts into the VM:
    bigsql_customizations.sh (place the file in /root)
    bigsql_grants.sh (place the file in /home/bigsql)
    bigsql_hdfs_folders.sh (place the file in /home/hdfs)
 2. Make sure of the following:
    bigsql_customizations.sh is owned by root user.
    bigsql_grants.sh is owned by bigsql user.
    bigsql_hdfs_folders.sh is owned by hdfs.
 3. Make sure the file permissions are 744 for the three scripts.
 3. As root, run the first script only:
    cd /root
    ./bigsql_customizations.sh
    
The first script will invoke the other scripts.
The bigsql_grants.sh file will download the lab files from github and extract it in the proper location. So you don't need to manually download the labs.
