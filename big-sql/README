To customize the VM for the Big SQL labs:
 1. Download three scripts into the VM:
    bigsql_customizations.sh (place the file in /root)
    bigsql_grants.sh, bigsql_grantDBADM.sh, bigsql_revokeDBADM.sh (place the files in /home/bigsql)
    bigsql_hdfs_folders.sh (place the file in /home/hdfs)
 2. Copy users.csv file, which consists of two columns (The 1st column contains the account name and the 2nd one contains the email) to /root
<br>You can see a sample file at https://github.com/IBM-SkillsAcademy/big-data-eng-2020/blob/master/scripts/big-data-ecosystem/bdescripts/users.csv
<br> scp users.csv root@41.58.181.236:/root/users.csv
 2. Make sure of the following:
    bigsql_customizations.sh is owned by root user.
    bigsql_grants.sh, bigsql_grantDBADM.sh, bigsql_revokeDBADM.sh are owned by bigsql user.
    bigsql_hdfs_folders.sh is owned by hdfs.
 3. Make sure the file permissions are 744 for the three scripts.
 4. As root, run the first script only:
    cd /root
    ./bigsql_customizations.sh
	

The first script will invoke the other scripts.
The bigsql_grants.sh file will download the lab files from github and extract it in the proper location. So you don't need to manually download the labs.

2. cd /home/bigsql
3. su bigsql
4. ./bigsql_grantDBADM.sh

After running Bigsql Ex. 6 run bigsql_revokeDBADM.sh as below:
